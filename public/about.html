<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Welcome to my corner of the internet!. My name is James Ojajuni Oladipupo, born on September 25, 2003.
I'm a passionate web developer currently studying Mechatronics Engineering at Federal University, Oye-Ekiti. This interdisciplinary field combines mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering, providing me with a unique perspective on integrating technology and automation.
<p>
My academic journey has allowed me to deepen my knowledge in both web development and mechatronics, blending these interests to create innovative solutions. I specialize in full-stack development and I'm excited about leveraging my skills in these areas.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not immersed in my studies or coding projects, I enjoy playing video games and board games, reading and learning about new things. Balancing my academic and personal life helps me stay inspired and motivated.

<p>
Throughout my development career so far, I've had the opportunity to work on the <a href="./birthday-invite.html">birthday invite project</a> and the <a href="./movie-ranking.html">movie ranking project</a>. These experiences have enriched my skills and fueled my enthusiasm for both web development and mechatronics.
</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, I'm excited to work on creating an e-comerce website and also work on interdisciplinary projects, further explore emerging technologies, or contribute to innovative solutions in tech. I'm committed to continuous learning and delivering high-quality work in every project I undertake.
